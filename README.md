# Keep it Smart and Simple - REST

When I read about event-based and functional languages, the first thought that came into my mind was: "the problem they want to solve is not related to a language, but to how frameworks have been implemented". Yes, I'm talking about Node and Clojure on one side and Spring Boot, Java's JAX-RS, and Jersey on the other.

Then I decided to try to create a simple & fun, yet full-featured framework to write REST software.
